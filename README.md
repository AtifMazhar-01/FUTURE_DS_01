# Task 1: Business Sales Dashboard (Power BI)

## Overview
This project focuses on analyzing real-world e-commerce sales data using Power BI.
The objective of the dashboard is to help understand overall sales performance,
identify best-selling products, observe seasonal sales trends, and analyze revenue
distribution across different countries.

The dashboard is designed from a business perspective, keeping decision-makers
in mind, and emphasizes clarity, interactivity, and actionable insights rather
than complex technical modeling.

## Dataset
- **Dataset Name:** Online Retail Dataset (2009–2010)
- **Description:** Transaction-level data from an online retail store, including
  product details, quantities sold, prices, order dates, and customer locations.
- **Source:** Publicly available e-commerce transaction dataset
- **Time Period Covered:** 2009 to 2010

Basic data cleaning was performed to remove invalid and incomplete records
(such as missing customer IDs and negative quantities) to improve analysis accuracy.

## Tools & Technologies Used
- **Power BI Desktop** – for data modeling, visualization, and dashboard creation  
- **Microsoft Excel** – for initial data inspection and formatting  

No advanced programming or machine learning techniques were used, as the
focus of this task was on data analytics and business insights.

## Key KPIs Included
The dashboard highlights the following key performance indicators:

- **Total Revenue** – Overall sales generated during the selected period  
- **Total Orders** – Number of unique transactions  
- **Total Items Sold** – Total quantity of products sold  
- **Average Order Value (AOV)** – Average revenue generated per order  
- **Revenue per Customer** – Average revenue contribution per customer  

These KPIs provide a quick summary of business performance at a glance.

## Dashboard Analysis & Visuals
The dashboard includes multiple interactive visuals such as:

- Monthly sales trend to identify seasonality and peak sales periods  
- Best-selling products analysis to highlight revenue-driving items  
- Country-wise revenue and quantity distribution  
- KPI cards for high-level business metrics  
- Slicers for date range, quarter, and country to enable dynamic filtering  

The visuals are designed to be simple, clean, and easy to interpret for
non-technical users.

## Key Insights
Some of the important insights observed from the analysis include:

- Sales show a strong peak during year-end months, indicating seasonal demand  
- A small number of products contribute a large portion of total revenue  
- The United Kingdom is the top-performing market in terms of sales and volume  
- Sales and quantity trends follow a similar pattern over time  
- Data cleaning significantly improved the reliability of insights

## Deliverable
The final deliverable is an **interactive Power BI dashboard** that allows users
to explore sales performance, identify trends, and gain business insights through
filters and visuals. This dashboard is suitable for high-level business analysis
and decision-making.
